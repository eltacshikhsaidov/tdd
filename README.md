# Test Driven Development 
- First: create the actual class and implement some methods with minimal implementation (errors also should be there)
- Second: apply some logic in order to fix the problems caused from above sentence
- Third: refactor the whole code after passing red-green stages (so, final result called ```red-green-refactoring pattern```)
